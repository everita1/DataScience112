There are multiple common file types. We have so far used .csv files, but there are many others like:

-   Excel files: `.xls`, `.xlsx`

-   R “data serialization” files: `.rds`

-   files with tab-separated values: `.tsv`

Data repositories are ideal when you're not looking for specific data.

For more specific data, search engines like Google are better. You can specify searches with keywords, and by specifying data type. i.e. pet adoption, file type: .csv.

You should save your data on your computer to avoid relying on another person/institution.

When important data into rstudio, two things are especially important:

-   File type

    -   indicates which function we will need to import.

        -   read_csv, read_delim, etc.

-   File location

    -   to import, we need to apply the correct function to the file path

        -   a file path is an address to where the file is stored on the computer.

Once the data has been imported, ask an answer some important preliminary questions like:

-   what is the structure of the data?

-   what needs to be cleaned and organized?

Now, you need to understand the data:

-   where does it come from?

-   who can I reach out to?
